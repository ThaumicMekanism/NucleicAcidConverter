    <p style='padding: 10px;'>NOTICE: I am currently working on a native ios app. This is the one using phonegap. It works pretty well but still has some issues. Sorry for the issues.</p>
    <p style='padding: 10px;'>This app is under heavy development. I know there are a few bugs that I am working on. I am just trying to push a release so people can use this app. ENJOY!</p>
